The page will start with a few sample buttons at the top

When the buttons are clicked, we call the Giphy API and show 10 still gifs of whatever the user typed in the field. A button will also be created with the field contents.

If the user clicks and image, it will animate. If the image is clicked again, it will go back to a still state
